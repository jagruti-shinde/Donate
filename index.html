        <h5>Why are farmers attempting suicides?</h5>
        <p>The condition of farmers in India is critical. We are hearing suicide news of farmers every week or month. Moreover, 
          farmers are all living a difficult life from past years. The problem is they are not getting enough pay. 
          Since the middlemen get most of the money, so a farmer gets nothing in hand. Moreover, farmers are not having money to send their 
          kids to school. Sometimes the situation gets so worse that they are not even having proper food. Thus farmers go in famine. As a result, they attempt suicides.</br>

        <h5>Why are farmers attempting suicides?</h5>
        <p>Farmers are attempting suicides because their profession is not providing 
          them even food to eat. Moreover, their farms are getting destroyed. 
          As a result, it leaves them with nothing.</br>

        <h5>hello</h5>
        <p>tFarmer suicides have been taking place across India for years now, 
          and studies of rural distress reveal the deeply-rooted, tenacious causes, 
          such as lack of irrigation, fragmentation of land, unsuitability of seeds 
          and inadequate sources of credit.</br>

        <p>In order to save farmers, our Government is trying to provide them with 
          various privileges. Recently the government has exempted them from all the loans. 
          Moreover, the government pays an annual pension of Rs. 6000 to them. 
          This helps them to at least have some earning apart from their profession.
           Furthermore, the government provides quotas (reservations) to their children. 
           This ensures that their children get a proper education. 
           All the children should get a proper education in todayâ€™s world. 
           So that they get a chance to live a better life.</br>
